# Improved Afflictions

Improved Afflictions is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

Improved Afflictions aims to make The Long Dark more challenging by changing and overhauling some of the games' afflictions with new causes, effects and varying lengths. 

## Pain

Pain now lasts much longer and represents the lingering effects of the injury sustained. The usual causes of pain are still there, sprains. But there are several new ways to obtain pain.
Such as animal bites resulting in blood loss, blunt trauma from falling off heights or animal attacks, broken ribs, etc...

### The Effects of Pain

Once pain has been contracted, it will cause varying degrees of discomfort and other negative effects. Even after you've healed the affliction causing it. The first thing you will notice
is that pain now lasts much longer. The time varies depending on the severity of the injury and the area of the body afflicted. Generally speaking, the hands and feet last the least and the
neck and head last the longest. 

While suffering from pain, you may notice increased visual effects. Pain on the neck and head will cause more blurred vision than other areas of the body. 

Pain on the hands will cause action times (such as breaking down) to take longer.
Pain on the feet will lead to slower movement (but no limping).

Two injured hands, two injured feet, an injured foot and leg or injured hand and arm will prevent the ability to climb ropes. If you are injured in one area but still able to climb ropes the 
time to do so will be impacted significantly. 

### Concussion

Blunt trauma to the head may result in a concussion, a new form of pain that lasts a long time and causes blurred and tunnel vision. It is caused by falling off great heights, such as a climbing rope
or encounters with large animals like bears or moose. While attacked or falling off a rope, there is a chance you will contract a concussion. 

### Painkillers

The effects of pain do not go away quickly, your injuries take time to heal. Unlike in vanilla, painkillers will not instantly heal any pain you have. There are no quick fixes. 
Painkillers are a way to temporarily ease the effects of pain. You only need to take painkillers once, not per injury. When you take painkillers, they will take approximately 20 minutes to kick in. 
Once the painkillers are in your system, the effects of pain will be diminished but not entirely gone. They will last for several hours until you need to take them again. 

## Food Poisoning & Dysentery

Food poisoning & dysentery are now more common, more deadly and take longer to recover from. 

Low quality food has a much higher chance of making you ill, the type of food will dictate what disease you contract. Generally, wet foods will contain dysentery causing bacteria. Including sodas.
If the food makes you sick, it will take some time for the effects of the disease to kick in so you won't notice until much later. 

Both illnesses will drain you, weakaning you until you die. Resting is still the best way to recover but both diseases will heal over time on their own. However taking antibiotics will reduce their
impact on your health. Condition loss isn't stunted when sleeping, although it is dimished, especially while on antibiotics. 

The amount of condition you lose while sick from food poisoning will depends on your other stats, including number of injuries.

## Hypothermia

While under the cold grip of hypothermia, you will feel colder all around and warming up will take slightly more time.

## Scurvy

Scurvy is now more deadly. A low vitamin c diet has resulted in any vitamin c devoid foods being far less nutritious. Foods without vitamin c or low vitamin c will give 50% less calories. In addition,
you will get tired and colder much quicker. Along with a slight increase the carry capacity penalty. 

## Chemical Poisoning

Taking a stroll through clouds of corrosive fumes will affect you much quicker, so you have less time to stand around those chemical barrels. The vanilla affliction has some harsh debuffs alone, so alongside that you may also acquire chemical burns on your hands and feet. The toxic chemicals will eat away at your footwear, including socks, in vanilla. But there is no penalty to not wearing any. Not anymore! When your chemical poisoning risk reaches 25% or higher, you will get corrosive chemical burns on your feet if you're not wearing protection. At 35%, your hands can get burned too if you're not wearing any gloves (hand coverings do not decay as of 1.1.0). These burns affect your ability to climb ropes, break down objects, craft, etc... either by outright preventing or slowing down the process. 

Note: Chemical burns are in the form of Pain.
